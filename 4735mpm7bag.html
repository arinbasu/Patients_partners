<div>Searches in Pubmed, CINAHL, and Ovid revealed few articles that were published between 2013 and 2018 on the themes of either P4 medicine or participatory medicine or health care in the context of general practice. None of the retrieved articles related to issues relevant to P4 medicine in the sense of personalised, participatory, preventive, or predictive. The term participatory was found in the title words, abstracts and full texts of all of these articles but they referred to a care process where the provider would tailor the treatment for the individual patient, as opposed to the concept of "participatory care" envisioned in P4 medicine where the patients and providers would together share data and information to arrive at the best care process and optimise health outcome in the context of general practice.&nbsp; Hence in the remainder of the paper, we discuss personalised, preventive, predictive, and participatory health care in the context of general practice and emphasise how participatory health care can be a cornerstone of this new paradigm of care and how general practitioners can be at the forefront of this practice.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="349196" class="ltx_title_subsection">Discussion</h2><div></div><h2 data-label="861514" class="ltx_title_subsection">What is meant by systems medicine and P4 Health Care?</h2><div>Flores et.al. (2013) has provided an overview of systems medicine and P4 medicine, from the perspectives of critiquing a review of three reports by IOM on systems medicine&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flores:2013kc}</cite>&nbsp;. Fothat new kind of engagement with patients will be needed for systmes medicine or P4 medicine to work effectively but these were not captured in the IOM reports. Three defining characteristics or drivng forces: (1) systems medicine/systems biology as emergent trend, (2) availability of data analytic tools or big data analytic tools and advances in computing, (3) emergence of networks of people or people getting increasingly connected through social networks or using social&nbsp; networks. This will lead to five transformations: (1) medical and procedural knowledge will be based on availablity of big data and their analyses; (2) diseases will be classified based on their molecular signatures and genetic and gene-environmental interactions related causes rather than as we have now using ICD-10 Clinical manifestations, (3) drug discoveries will be based on systematic innovations and development of new technologies (biology will drive technology will drive analyses and new idea generation and this will set up a cycle) so less serendipity and more on hypotheses generation that will be systematically invesigated; (4) care will move from hospitals and clinics to increasingly in home and workplaces, and patients will take more ownerships of their health status; (5) the focus will shift from diseased care to more and more wellness care and hence a new class of healthcare industry will emerge based on wellness care and keeping people healthy. This is the basis of P4 health care personalised, preventive, predictive, and participatory health care. Personalised health care would mean that analysis of big data and "data cloud" for each person will lead to further classification and stratification of patients based on molecular signatures with respect to their disease progression and prognosis and likelihood of development of disease and complication. For example, by identifying gene signatures and network patterns, it'd be possible to stratify an individual patient whether he will develop complications of type II diabetes and indeed, the typology of diabetes will change as well, and more subtypes will be identified and these subtypes will then determine the course of treatment and prognosis. This is referred to as precision medicine but this nomenclature misses the other aspects: predictive - as increased and precise defintion of the causes will be available, it'd be possible using data analysis to predict the course of disease or progression of disease or from healthy state to disease state; preventive as increasingly prevention of disease will be the focus and partiicpatory indicates that patients will ncreasingly take part actively by self measuring and providing data and connecting with each otehr through networks. P4 medicine will be based on systems mediicne which will study networks at different levels and their inter-relationships: genetic networkis, molecular networks, cellular networks within individuals, tissue/organ-level networks and social networks and networks of networks to define diseases. This will rest on five conceptual pillars: (1) methods to obtain and archive data, (2) tools and structures to make use of those data, (3) availability of pesonal data clouds which will include genomic information, environmental information, clinical information, (4) analytic techniques to make use of the data generated, and (5) a systems biology approach where networks are analysed to make sense of the data; final conclusion. -- new forms of patient engagement will be needed for this to happen; reasoning - people already make use of existing social networks and therefore this trend will continue; if patients are made aware of the lifestyle choices they can take to reduce their diseae risk or progression, then they will adopt them; physicians are not the only players and they prescribe medications if a patient approaches them but in future patients will be able tomanage themselves being organised and using new information; critique. -- this paper was written in 2013, and as of 2018, some of these trends are seen but it is not clear to what extent is p4 healthcare taking off - the digital data analysis capabiity has increased, more and more genetic network studies are made available, but the connections between patient social network, gene network and the dissemination of information to the patients to change their lifestyle is not as well developed. time to revise or reasses the model in light of new evidence that generated; evidence</div><div></div><div></div><div>Models of Participatory Health care</div><div></div><div>What would Dr Morris do?</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Conclusion</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>A search of the participatory health care suggests that there are several channels, processes and athw</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>e-patients</div><div>P4 medicine (participatory, predictive, preventive, and personalised medicine) </div><div>How these are different from traditional medical practices</div><div></div><div>Methods of search and selection of studies</div><div></div><div>Findings</div><div></div><div>Discussion</div><div></div><div></div><div>Studies have differeed in what works best for fostering patient centric care.

Two major drivers are availability of broadband and personal motivation.&nbsp; Availability of home broadband is a determinant for Internet access. Those with chronic conditions are more likely to search for internet based health information. those with recent diagnoses are more likely to engage with their doctors on the information they identified on the net.&nbsp; Pew's 2007 Internet Life project found that despite wide availability of health related information, doctors were stil main source of information for the patients.

When he first wrote about his comments about medical record&nbsp; in a blog, Boston Globe, a newpaper in the US questioned his authority or right to write about something he was not supposed to know. He had renal cell carcinoma with multiple metastases and fractured femur in 2009. He underwent nephrectomy. He has argued what is value in the context of medicine from a patient's perspective.&nbsp; Awareness of status (he did not know at the time of his diagnosis that he had cancer, a "spot" in his Xray was the diagnostic marker); accuracy of diagnosis - his doctors used both radiological findings and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis;&nbsp; he received state of the art treatment that are denied to most people he knows; his surgical &amp; clinical care was excellent. Among the system varialbles, he has listed access to care, access to information, choice of provider. Beyond systemic and instutitional issues, he listed that his being informed and engaged helped him. These were taking action to get examined, his advanced planning, his information seeking about choosing providers. He accessed&nbsp;<a href="http://acor.org/" target="_blank">ACOR.org</a>, which is an online community of cancer patients who provide information and share information with each other.&nbsp; He was direxcted to him by his GP, and he found messages for him within two hours of starting to use ACOR.org website.&nbsp;</div><blockquote><div>If peer review is the only true path to reliability, how can a patient community have better facts?</div></blockquote><div></div>
