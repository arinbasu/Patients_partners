<div></div><div></div><div>Searches in Pubmed, CINAHL, and Ovid revealed few articles that were published between 2013 and 2018 on the themes of either P4 medicine or participatory medicine or health care in the context of general practice. None of the retrieved articles related to issues relevant to P4 medicine in the sense of personalised, participatory, preventive, or predictive. The term participatory was found in the title words, abstracts and full texts of all of these articles but they referred to a care process where the provider would tailor the treatment for the individual patient, as opposed to the concept of "participatory care" envisioned in P4 medicine where the patients and providers would together share data and information to arrive at the best care process and optimise health outcome in the context of general practice.&nbsp; Hence in the remainder of the paper, we discuss personalised, preventive, predictive, and participatory health care in the context of general practice and emphasise how participatory health care can be a cornerstone of this new paradigm of care and how general practitioners can be at the forefront of this practice.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="349196" class="ltx_title_subsection">Discussion</h2><div></div><h2 data-label="861514" class="ltx_title_subsection">What is meant by systems medicine and P4 Health Care?</h2><div></div><div>The structure of the human genome was first identified in 2003 (project started in 1995); this work was accomplished in record time; however this only provided a roadmap and structure of the human genome with the lists of genes and their locations (citation?). Further work on networks of genes, transcriptomes, and molecules provided deeper knowledge in how the networks of the different structures determined the function of these entities in biology. This is referred to as “systems biology”. Systems medicine refers to the phenomenon of applying the principles and practices&nbsp;of systems biology to the domain of human diseases (cites??).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Flores et.al. (2013) has provided an overview of systems medicine and P4 medicine, from the perspectives of critiquing a review of three reports by the US Institue of Medicine on systems medicine&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Flores:2013kc}</cite>&nbsp;. Flores has argued that a new kind of engagement with patients will be needed for systmes medicine or P4 medicine to work effectively, and that three defining characteristics are drivng forces behind the emergence and adoption of systems medicine and P4 health care now. In no particular order, these are as follows: first, systems medicine/systems biology is an emergent trend; second, availability of data analytic tools, specifically, big data analytic tools and advances in computing; third, emergence of networks of people where individuals are getting increasingly connected through social networks or otherwise in a trend of increasing use of social&nbsp; networks not only for communication but also for archives of data sharing for individuals. </div><div></div><div>Flores has argued that in future, driven by these emergent trends, health care will undergo five transformations. First, production of medical knowledge and advancements in medical and surgical procedures will undergo a transformation from its current state of being driven by “serendipity” and small samples of homogenous populations to one that will be based on large data sets and  their analyses (referred to as big data). Second, diseases will undergo a change in their taxonomy: at present, diseases are classified based on symptomatology: in future, diseases will be classified based on their genetic and molecular signatures and genetic and gene-environmental interactions that relate to their causes of occurrence. Third, pharmacological discoveries will be based on systematic innovations and development of new technologies. Leroy Hood (2013) has argued that biology will drive technology will drive analyses and new idea generation and this will set up a cycle (Hood??). Hence, the proponents of systems medicine argue that in future, discoveries in Medicine and health sciences will likely to be less driven by serendipity and more driven by emphasis on hypotheses generation that will be systematically invesigated. Fourth, delivery of health care, at this time, is centred on clinics &amp; hospitals; in future, with empowered patients and focus on wellness, &nbsp;provision of health will increasingly shift from hospitals and clinics to the home and workplaces where patients spend most of their time, and patients will take more ownerships of their health status. Fifth, the focus of health care delivery will shift from care of the diseased&nbsp;to wellness care. This will lead to the emergence of a new class of healthcare industry based on "wellness care" and "keeping people healthy” so that transition probability of a healthy person to a diseased state would be “diagnosed early” and resources will be spent to “keep people healthy as long as possible”.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Such changes would form the basis of P4 health care; the four “P”s include: &nbsp;personalised, preventive, predictive, and participatory health care. Personalised health care would mean that analysis of big data and "data cloud" for each person will lead to finer classification and stratification of patients based on molecular signatures with respect to their disease progression and prognosis and likelihood of development of disease and complication. For example, by identifying gene signatures and network patterns, it'd be possible to stratify an individual patient whether he will develop complications of type II diabetes and indeed, the typology of diabetes will change as well, and more subtypes will be identified and these subtypes will then determine the course of treatment and prognosis. This is also the basis of precision medicine. As systems medicine has focused on identifying the network of different genes, molecules, cells, and organs, the proponents of systems medicine argue that transition from a state of health to a state of illness is explained by a change in the network; if this network effect were to be studied and manipulated it would mean that the disease conditions could be either “reversed” in their earlier stages of kept from occurring as long as is feasible (“predictive” and “preventive”). “Participatory" indicates that patients will ncreasingly take part actively by self measuring and providing data and connecting with each other through networks. </div><div></div><div>Hood (2017) has argued that P4 medicine is at a "tipping point" in 2016. Gladwell (2006) has described the phrase "tipping point" in his book by the same name, as a phenomenon when a slow growing idea that was growing slowly, at a point in time, that idea gets adopted by majority population and spreads faster than ever". He argues that P4 medicine (predictive, preventive, personalised, and participatory) medicine that will help to model transition from health to disease state and therefore enable earlier detection of diseases and their halting will lead to emergence of scientific wellness. Predictive here indicates that the genetic risk for diseases can be estimated for most diseases and these would enable model the transition of a healthy person to a diseased person and if that would be known early enough, then it would be possible to generate therapy or approaches that would prevent the emergence of disease from wellness (prevention); personalised medicine refers to the idea that individuals and diseases can be stratified to identify finer subtypes of diseases than what exists now and therefore instead of assuming that individuals are homogeneous as is the norm in large trials now, it would be possible to finely stratify diseases and humans into disease subtypes and clusters based on their personal data clouds and therefore better characterise disease pathologies and subtypes and specific remedies. Participatory medicine refers to the idea that each individual would be able to take care of his or her own wellness guided by wellness coaches and using social networking so that more people would be able to lead healthy lives. He described that four technologies converged to make this happen: emergence of systems medicine where study of genes and networks of genes, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, and humans themselves were layered one over another; digital technology has developed so that each human can have millions of data points that form a cloud around them that can be harnessed to generate new patterns of knowledge; big data science is maturing so that large data sets can be analysed to improve on signal:noise ratio than what exists now, and social networking and social media will enable more efficient and effective sharing of knowledge. As a result more people will live healthy lives into their 90s. Hood etal initiated studies with 108 indivdiuals and preliminary results are being published in leading journals. His research institute ISB has teamed up with healthcare provider organisations to deeply reearch "scientific wellness" and this programme will shift the focus to wellness as opposed to diseases that is the current paradigm. Final conclusion. -- Scientific wellness will be the future of health care and P4 healthcare is the new paradigm where the focus is on wellness. Reasons. -- Four ideas converge and make this possible + early studies show the potential + Evidence. -- 108 pioneer based studies and early results ; critique. -- Many of these statements are speculative but it is also feasible as it brings many technologies and ideas together to generate new knowledge; questions. -- What would be the relationship between P4 wellness and the achievement of health status? How would we know? Who will deliver the approaches? What will be the role of primary health physicians?

When he first wrote about his comments about medical record&nbsp; in a blog, Boston Globe, a newpaper in the US questioned his authority or right to write about something he was not supposed to know. He had renal cell carcinoma with multiple metastases and fractured femur in 2009. He underwent nephrectomy. He has argued what is value in the context of medicine from a patient's perspective.&nbsp; Awareness of status (he did not know at the time of his diagnosis that he had cancer, a "spot" in his Xray was the diagnostic marker); accuracy of diagnosis - his doctors used both radiological findings and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis;&nbsp; he received state of the art treatment that are denied to most people he knows; his surgical &amp; clinical care was excellent. Among the system varialbles, he has listed access to care, access to information, choice of provider. Beyond systemic and instutitional issues, he listed that his being informed and engaged helped him. These were taking action to get examined, his advanced planning, his information seeking about choosing providers. He accessed&nbsp;<a href="http://acor.org/" target="_blank">ACOR.org</a>, which is an online community of cancer patients who provide information and share information with each other.&nbsp; He was direxcted to him by his GP, and he found messages for him within two hours of starting to use ACOR.org website.&nbsp;</div><blockquote><div>If peer review is the only true path to reliability, how can a patient community have better facts?</div></blockquote><div></div>
