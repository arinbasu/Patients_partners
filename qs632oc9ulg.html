<div></div><div>The purpose of this review is to review the state of the art knowledge on patient-centric care and what programmes are effective in primary care for patient-centric care? </div><div></div><div></div><div>Introduction</div><div></div><div>Dr Morris is a general practitioner at a general practice located in a university. One of his patients is a university lecturer in Epidemiology, and attends his clinic for consultation about his recent "blood reports". The patient is a 50-year old university lecturer and was diagnosed with hypertension and Type II diabetes. He is currently stabilised with metformin and antihypertensive medication; he has no other significant illness, and he has family history of heart disease in his family (father passed away 17 years ago following a second attack of AMI). In previous consultation, Dr Morris found that his patient had HbAic of 55 umol/l and in a recent check in January, his glycosylated haemoglobin level "went up" to 70 umol/l. All other blood parameters were within normal limits. The patient reported that he "tried" to maintain a healthy lifestyle (he turned "vegetarian" a month ago, and was irregularly started jog three miles every other day). Dr Morris was considered if he should change his patient's medication but decided to discuss with his patient first. His patient asked for another "three months' trial" to change his lifestyle and told him that he had discussed this in a social network that he subscribes to and several of his "online friends" benefitted from buying an exercise wrist band and logging their data on the portal. He told him that he would bring his exercise and diet data on the next consultation if Dr Morris would like to review them and incorporate these data i</div><div></div><div>Participatory medicine is the cornerstone of a new emergent paradigm of medical care referred to as P4 health care. P4 healthcare consists of four related concepts: personalised health care where health care is tailored to the context and need of the patient or the consumer who will use the health care; predictive health care where based on genomic, environmental and clinical data, the health provider will predict possible needs and patterns of utilisation and tailor the provision of care based on the predicted patterns of health services utilisation; preventive health care where health care provision will be focused to keep people free of disease as long as possible and as much as possible. This will be based on understanding the patterns of the emergence and progression of disease based on study of gene networks, molecular networks, networks of how cells, tissues, and organs interact with each other in healthy and disease states, and how patients themselves interact with each other in social networks; and participatory health care where patients share their personal data, and make use of the "personal cloud" of health information that drives their anticipated or assessed need for health care and share information with each other, support each other and thus enhance the value of health care information. It is the fourth concept, that of participatory health care, that forms the basis of delivery of health care. The personalised and the predictive care are dependent on availablity of data and archival and analyses of complex data to identify subsets of disease conditions, causes, stratification of patients, and based on the stratification and clustering, matching of interventions and disease conditions; the preventive aspect of P4 depends on the compliance of the individual patient and the provider advice, but the aspect of partiicpatory health care forms the "bulwark" of this concept: the quality of the data and their subsequent analyses to drive the decision making process and discovery of novel patterns for classification, clustering, stratification, and prediction will depend on the quantity and quality of the data the patients and consumers of health care would willingly share; besides, for participatory health care to be functional, the patients and consumers of the health care would need to be in a social network or utilise a network of care or their own information sharing network that would also be transparent to the providers and other players of the system: if that does not work, then the process of P4 healthcare falls through. </div>
