P4 healthcare consists of four related concepts: personalised health care where health care is tailored to the context and need of the patient or the consumer who will use the health care; predictive health care where based on genomic, environmental and clinical data, the health provider will predict possible needs and patterns of utilisation and tailor the provision of care based on the predicted patterns of health services utilisation; preventive health care where health care provision will be focused to keep people free of disease as long as possible and as much as possible. This will be based on understanding the patterns of the emergence and progression of disease based on study of gene networks, molecular networks, networks of how cells, tissues, and organs interact with each other in healthy and disease states, and how patients themselves interact with each other in social networks; and participatory health care where patients share their personal data, and make use of the "personal cloud" of health information that drives their anticipated or assessed need for health care and share information with each other, support each other and thus enhance the value of health care information. It is the fourth concept, that of participatory health care, that forms the basis of delivery of health care. The personalised and the predictive care are dependent on availablity of data and archival and analyses of complex data to identify subsets of disease conditions, causes, stratification of patients, and based on the stratification and clustering, matching of interventions and disease conditions; the preventive aspect of P4 depends on the compliance of the individual patient and the provider advice, but the aspect of partiicpatory health care forms the "bulwark" of this concept: the quality of the data and their subsequent analyses to drive the decision making process and discovery of novel patterns for classification, clustering, stratification, and prediction will depend on the quantity and quality of the data the patients and consumers of health care would willingly share; besides, for participatory health care to be functional, the patients and consumers of the health care would need to be in a social network or utilise a network of care or their own information sharing network that would also be transparent to the providers and other players of the system: if that does not work, then the process of P4 healthcare falls through. </div>
