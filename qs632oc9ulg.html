Two major drivers are availability of broadband and personal motivation.&nbsp; Availability of home broadband is a determinant for Internet access. Those with chronic conditions are more likely to search for internet based health information. those with recent diagnoses are more likely to engage with their doctors on the information they identified on the net.&nbsp; Pew's 2007 Internet Life project found that despite wide availability of health related information, doctors were stil main source of information for the patients. Only three percent reported that they were harmed by information they received online <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{fox2008engaged}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>This review or recapitulation of the Pew Internet Project on the life of&nbsp; Americans present a partial but somewhat dated view of the actual picture but this is the only record we have. Since then, the situations have changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Shmuel Giveon et.al. (2009) thought that due to wide access to internet and internet based information on health, the nature of doctor-patient relationships have changed to a more participatory type of relationship. The team wanted to know how did doctors themselves feel about it? How satisfied are they about it? They conducted a self-reported survey of xxx doctors in Israel and found that. One time cross sectional survey of 100 family practice doctors. These doctors were enrolled in a CME activity. they were phoned. They found that the physicians reponded favourably when they were asked about their attitudes towards their patients brining in information from the Internet to them&nbsp; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{giveon2009patient}</cite></div><div></div><div>Not peer-reviewed (for introduction/discussion)</div><div>Dave deBronkert (e-patient Dave, 2013) narrated a personal experience. When he first wrote about his comments about medical record&nbsp; in a blog, Boston Globe, a newpaper in the US questioned his authority or right to write about something he was not supposed to know. He had renal cell carcinoma with multiple metastases and fractured femur in 2009. He underwent nephrectomy. He has argued what is value in the context of medicine from a patient's perspective.&nbsp; Awareness of status (he did not know at the time of his diagnosis that he had cancer, a "spot" in his Xray was the diagnostic marker); accuracy of diagnosis - his doctors used both radiological findings and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis;&nbsp; he received state of the art treatment that are denied to most people he knows; his surgical &amp; clinical care was excellent. Among the system varialbles, he has listed access to care, access to information, choice of provider. Beyond systemic and instutitional issues, he listed that his being informed and engaged helped him. These were taking action to get examined, his advanced planning, his information seeking about choosing providers. He accessed&nbsp;<a href="http://acor.org/" target="_blank">ACOR.org</a>, which is an online community of cancer patients who provide information and share information with each other.&nbsp; He was direxcted to him by his GP, and he found messages for him within two hours of starting to use ACOR.org website.&nbsp;</div><blockquote><div>If peer review is the only true path to reliability, how can a patient community have better facts?</div></blockquote><div></div>
