<div></div><div>The purpose of this review is to review the state of the art knowledge on patient-centric care and what programmes are effective in primary care for patient-centric care? </div><div></div><div></div><div>Introduction</div><div></div><div>Dr Morris is a general practitioner at a general practice situated in a university. One of his patients is a university lecturer in Epidemiology, and attended his clinic for consultation about his recent "blood reports". This patient is a 50-year old male university lecturer. He was diagnosed with hypertension and Type II diabetes for about ten years. He is currently stabilised with metformin and antihypertensive medications; he has no other significant illness, he is a non-smoker, and does not drink alcohol at all. He has a history of diabetes (his father had diabetes and died due to "heart attack" 17 years ago), hypertension (mother has hypertension and is alive), and heart disease in his family. </div><div></div><div>Dr Morris reviewed the earlier records for this patient and found that he had glycosylated haemoglobin of 55 umol/l six months ago, and&nbsp; a week ago, his glycosylated haemoglobin level "went up" to 70 umol/l. All other blood parameters were within normal limits. The patient reported that he "tried" to maintain a healthy lifestyle (he turned "vegetarian" a month ago, and began jogging three miles twice a week). </div><div></div><div>Dr Morris was considered if he should change his patient's antidiabetic medication but decided to discuss with his patient first. His patient asked for another "three months' trial" to see the effects of change in his lifestyle. The patient said that he had consulted WebMD, an online information portal, and discussed his health status in a disease based social network named patientslikeme.com that he subscribes. He said that several of his "online friends" benefitted from buying exercise wrist bands and logging their data on the portal. He showed Dr Morris that his cell phone logged his running distance, time, his water, and calorie intake; he said he never missed his "pills" as he paired his "smart pill box" with his cellphone he bought from Singapore, and that, he would bring his glucometer readings, exercise and diet data on the next consultation if Dr Morris would like to review them. He asked Dr Morris if he could incorporate these data in the electronic medical record he used. </div><div></div><div>Dr Morris wondered how he could use this new information that the patient has generated and is about to offer him and what would that mean for care planning for this patient. Dr Morris wondered if his action based on his patient's information about his lifestlethis would qualify for "participatory heath care".&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Participatory health care is the cornerstone of an emergent paradigm of medical care referred to as P4 health care. Professor Leroy Hood of Institute of Systems Biology coined the term "P4 healthcare". It is a composite concept of health care delivery and practice. This concept consists of four related themes, each starting with the letter "P": "personalised health care" where health care is tailored to the context and need of the patient or the consumer who will use the health care; predictive health care where based on genomic, environmental and clinical data, the health provider will predict possible needs and patterns of utilisation and tailor the provision of care based on the predicted patterns of health services utilisation; preventive health care where health care provision will be focused to keep people free of disease as long as possible and as much as possible. This will be based on understanding the patterns of the emergence and progression of disease based on study of gene networks, molecular networks, networks of how cells, tissues, and organs interact with each other in healthy and disease states, and how patients themselves interact with each other in social networks; and participatory health care where patients share their personal data, and make use of the "personal cloud" of health information that drives their anticipated or assessed need for health care and share information with each other, support each other and thus enhance the value of health care information. It is the fourth concept, that of participatory health care, that forms the basis of delivery of health care. The personalised and the predictive care are dependent on availablity of data and archival and analyses of complex data to identify subsets of disease conditions, causes, stratification of patients, and based on the stratification and clustering, matching of interventions and disease conditions; the preventive aspect of P4 depends on the compliance of the individual patient and the provider advice, but the aspect of partiicpatory health care forms the "bulwark" of this concept: the quality of the data and their subsequent analyses to drive the decision making process and discovery of novel patterns for classification, clustering, stratification, and prediction will depend on the quantity and quality of the data the patients and consumers of health care would willingly share; besides, for participatory health care to be functional, the patients and consumers of the health care would need to be in a social network or utilise a network of care or their own information sharing network that would also be transparent to the providers and other players of the system: if that does not work, then the process of P4 healthcare falls through.&nbsp;</div>
