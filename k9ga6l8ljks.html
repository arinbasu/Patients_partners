<div>Compared with personalised, predictive, and preventive health care, participatory medicine is relatively well developed for several reasons. First, participatory health care aims to empower patients in the process of care and this has a long history. The importance of patients as partners in care is articulated in the definition of evidence based medicine and health, the current paradigm of medical/health care (cite definition of ebm, Sackett).&nbsp; Second, in 2009, Donald Ber In the nineties,&nbsp; empowerment of the patients and moving the paradigm of care from being "hospital centric" to more "patient home/workplace centric". This is facilitated when patients or health consumers have the tools and knowledge to organise care in their own settings, this in turn is helped if they have easy access to information sources &amp; support systems available round the clock. Access to social media and easy access to always-on internet service on their handheld devices and home computers (those who can access them) facilitate such practices.&nbsp; Besides, wellness industry is ready to provide handheld apps and wearable units that connect patients with hospitals and help to put data on the internet so that these are made accessible to the caregivers at all time (citation XXX) -- these factors facilitate the development and advancement of participatory aspect of the care in P4 health care paradigm ahead of the other three concepts. Hence we focus on participatory aspect of P4 health care in this paper.&nbsp;</div>
