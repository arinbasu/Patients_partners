<div>Of the four components of&nbsp;P4 healthcare, participatory care is also the most well de at this time. Systems medicine that forms the theoretical basis of P4 medicine,&nbsp; have developed a limited set of tools for a few disease conditions and the list is growing. As a result, the personalised aspect of health care to tailor and identify stratifications and clusters of disease conditions, and classification of diseases based on genomic and molecular signatures and causal patterns is still being developed. Flores et.al. (xxx) have argued that accuracy of predictions based on analyses of genomic networks and integrating them with clinical parameters are limited by the fact that, as the number of participants are still limited, exsiting predictions are based on more parameters to estimate than the number of participants available for study; are being developed and a limited number of studies have explored the association between gene networks and disease conditions (citations X, y, z ...); consequently, the predictive algorithms &amp; preventive actions that follow on from the predictive algorithms in turn depend on the availability and fine tuning of information fed to this pipeline by data analysed upstream.&nbsp;</div>
