<div>Of the four components of&nbsp;P4 healthcare, participatory care is also the most well developed at this time. Personalised health, also referred to as "precision health" is about clustering and stratification of diseases and patients based on genomic networks and molecular signatures. However,&nbsp; a limited set of tools for a few disease conditions are currently available, although the list will continue to grow (citations??). Flores et.al. (xxx) have argued that accuracy of predictions based on analyses of genomic networks and integrating them with clinical parameters is limited by the fact that existing predictions on who will develop diseases and/or complications are based on more parameters to estimate than the number of participants available to do the analyses; as a result, the predictive aare being developed and a limited number of studies have explored the association between gene networks and disease conditions (citations X, y, z ...); consequently, the predictive algorithms &amp; preventive actions that follow on from the predictive algorithms in turn depend on the availability and fine tuning of information fed to this pipeline by data analysed upstream.&nbsp;</div>
