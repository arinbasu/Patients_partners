  annote = {Syn. - Overview of systems medicine and P4 medicine, and a review of three reports by IOM on systems medicine. Argues that new kind of engagement with patients will be needed for systmes medicine or P4 medicine to work effectively but these were not captured in the IOM reports. Three defining characteristics or drivng forces: (1) systems medicine/systems biology as emergent trend, (2) availability of data analytic tools or big data analytic tools and advances in computing, (3) emergence of networks of people or people getting increasingly connected through social networks or using social  networks. This will lead to five transformations: (1) medical and procedural knowledge will be based on availablity of big data and their analyses; (2) diseases will be classified based on their molecular signatures and genetic and gene-environmental interactions related causes rather than as we have now using ICD-10 Clinical manifestations, (3) drug discoveries will be based on systematic innovations and development of new technologies (biology will drive technology will drive analyses and new idea generation and this will set up a cycle) so less serendipity and more on hypotheses generation that will be systematically invesigated; (4) care will move from hospitals and clinics to increasingly in home and workplaces, and patients will take more ownerships of their health status; (5) the focus will shift from diseased care to more and more wellness care and hence a new class of healthcare industry will emerge based on wellness care and keeping people healthy. This is the basis of P4 health care personalised, preventive, predictive, and participatory health care. Personalised health care would mean that analysis of big data and data cloud for each person will lead to further classification and stratification of patients based on molecular signatures with respect to their disease progression and prognosis and likelihood of development of disease and complication. For example, by identifying gene signatures and network patterns, it'd be possible to stratify an individual patient whether he will develop complications of type II diabetes and indeed, the typology of diabetes will change as well, and more subtypes will be identified and these subtypes will then determine the course of treatment and prognosis. This is referred to as precision medicine but this nomenclature misses the other aspects: predictive - as increased and precise defintion of the causes will be available, it'd be possible using data analysis to predict the course of disease or progression of disease or from healthy state to disease state; preventive as increasingly prevention of disease will be the focus and partiicpatory indicates that patients will ncreasingly take part actively by self measuring and providing data and connecting with each otehr through networks. P4 medicine will be based on systems mediicne which will study networks at different levels and their inter-relationships: genetic networkis, molecular networks, cellular networks within individuals, tissue/organ-level networks and social networks and networks of networks to define diseases. This will rest on five conceptual pillars: (1) methods to obtain and archive data, (2) tools and structures to make use of those data, (3) availability of pesonal data clouds which will include genomic information, environmental information, clinical information, (4) analytic techniques to make use of the data generated, and (5) a systems biology approach where networks are analysed to make sense of the data; final conclusion. -- new forms of patient engagement will be needed for this to happen; reasoning - people already make use of existing social networks and therefore this trend will continue; if patients are made aware of the lifestyle choices they can take to reduce their diseae risk or progression, then they will adopt them; physicians are not the only players and they prescribe medications if a patient approaches them but in future patients will be able tomanage themselves being organised and using new information; critique. -- this paper was written in 2013, and as of 2018, some of these trends are seen but it is not clear to what extent is p4 healthcare taking off - the digital data analysis capabiity has increased, more and more genetic network studies are made available, but the connections between patient social network, gene network and the dissemination of information to the patients to change their lifestyle is not as well developed. time to revise or reasses the model in light of new evidence that generated; evidence. -- several case studies, and websites, companies, etc. quotes. -- see below},

  annote = {Synopsis. -- Hood (2017) aruges that :4 medicine is at a tipping point in 2016 in the sense that Malcolm Gladwell mentioned that something happens at a point in time when an idea is adopted by majority population and spreads faster than ever. He argues that P4 medicine (predictive, preventive, personalised, and participatory) medicine that will help to model transition from health to disease state and therefore enable earlier detection of diseases and their halting will lead to emergence of scientific wellness. Predictive here indicates that the genetic risk for diseases can be estimated for most diseases and these would enable model the transition of a healthy person to a diseased person and if that would be known early enough, then it would be possible to generate therapy or approaches that would prevent the emergence of disease from wellness (prevention); personalised medicine refers to the idea that individuals and diseases can be stratified to identify finer subtypes of diseases than what exists now and therefore instead of assuming that individuals are homogeneous as is the norm in large trials now, it would be possible to finely stratify diseases and humans into disease subtypes and clusters based on their personal data clouds and therefore better characterise disease pathologies and subtypes and specific remedies. Participatory medicine refers to the idea that each individual would be able to take care of his or her own wellness guided by wellness coaches and using social networking so that more people would be able to lead healthy lives. He described that four technologies converged to make this happen: emergence of systems medicine where study of genes and networks of genes, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, and humans themselves were layered one over another; digital technology has developed so that each human can have millions of data points that form a cloud around them that can be harnessed to generate new patterns of knowledge; big data science is maturing so that large data sets can be analysed to improve on signal:noise ratio than what exists now, and social networking and social media will enable more efficient and effective sharing of knowledge. As a result more people will live healthy lives into their 90s. Hood etal initiated studies with 108 indivdiuals and preliminary results are being published in leading journals. His research institute ISB has teamed up with healthcare provider organisations to deeply reearch scientific wellness and this programme will shift the focus to wellness as opposed to diseases that is the current paradigm. Final conclusion. -- Scientific wellness will be the future of health care and P4 healthcare is the new paradigm where the focus is on wellness. Reasons. -- Four ideas converge and make this possible + early studies show the potential + Evidence. -- 108 pioneer based studies and early results ; critique. -- Many of these statements are speculative but it is also feasible as it brings many technologies and ideas together to generate new knowledge; questions. -- What would be the relationship between P4 wellness and the achievement of health status? How would we know? Who will deliver the approaches? What will be the role of primary health physicians? Quotes. --},
