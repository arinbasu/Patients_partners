<div>Dave deBronkert (e-patient Dave, 2013) is perhaps the most famous example of an e-patient in this context where narrated a personal experience. When he first wrote about his comments about medical record&nbsp; in a blog, Boston Globe, a newpaper in the US questioned his authority or right to write about something he was not supposed to know. He had renal cell carcinoma with multiple metastases and fractured femur in 2009. He underwent nephrectomy. He has argued what is value in the context of medicine from a patient's perspective.&nbsp; Awareness of status (he did not know at the time of his diagnosis that he had cancer, a "spot" in his Xray was the diagnostic marker); accuracy of diagnosis - his doctors used both radiological findings and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis;&nbsp; he received state of the art treatment that are denied to most people he knows; his surgical &amp; clinical care was excellent. Among the system varialbles, he has listed access to care, access to information, choice of provider. Beyond systemic and instutitional issues, he listed that his being informed and engaged helped him. He has defined value as creative destruction or disruptive innovation. He compares this with the desktop publishing that Mac brought about. In the early days, Mac's desktop publishing provided metrics and measurements and the laser printers were able to print out pages but the printers and typesetter were able to do better jobs. However, stakholders and end users liked the desktop publishing more than the printers' jobs.&nbsp;</div>
