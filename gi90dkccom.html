<div>ACOR rapidly updated itself and he validates this by citing the "war" between Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Brittanica where both information sources had similar rates of errors but Wikipedia fixed itself faster.&nbsp;He found stories of real life experiences in ACOR website. On the other hand, in the textbooks he consulted, he found "dry" facts. It can be argued that this is expected as textbooks written for professionals &amp; medical students are written for an audience who have specialised knowledge on the topic and are working in the field, and as such it is unrealistic to expect that a patient will grasp the complexity of medical terms. </div><div></div><div></div><div>Here he argues as Tom Faerguson has argued, that doctors need to pay attention to patients who are net savvy and can search information on the net. These patients are focused on one disease and one condition compared with doctors who must deal with a nmber of different conditions that they will need to keep their fingers on.
