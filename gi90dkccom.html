<div>ACOR rapidly updated itself and he validates this by citing the "war" between Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Brittanica where both information sources had similar rates of errors but Wikipedia fixed itself faster.&nbsp;He found stories of real life experiences in ACOR website. On the other hand, in the textbooks he consulted, he found "dry" facts. It can be argued that this is expected as textbooks written for professionals &amp; medical students are written for an audience who have specialised knowledge on the topic and are working in the field, and as such it is unrealistic to expect that a patient will grasp the complexity of medical terms. </div><div></div><div>He has defined value as creative destruction or disruptive innovation. He compares this with the desktop publishing that Mac brought about. In the early days, Mac's desktop publishing provided metrics and measurements and the laser printers were able to print out pages but the printers and typesetter were able to do better jobs. However, stakholders and end users liked the desktop publishing more than the printers' jobs.&nbsp;</div><div>Here he argues as Tom Faerguson has argued, that doctors need to pay attention to patients who are net savvy and can search information on the net. These patients are focused on one disease and one condition compared with doctors who must deal with a nmber of different conditions that they will need to keep their fingers on. This specialised knowledge of a single disease and empathic network with other patients can act complementarily. To this argument, Dave claims that this is economical and evidence based that working side by side with enabled patients lead to better outcomes.&nbsp;</div><div>(Need ot examine his claim) -- Written 26/01/2018</div><div></div><div>search terms</div><div>epatient[Title/Abstract] OR e-patient[Title/Abstract] AND ((Review[ptyp] OR Clinical Trial[ptyp]) AND "loattrfull text"[sb] AND "2008/01/31"[PDat] : "2018/01/27"[PDat] AND "humans"[MeSH Terms] AND English[lang])</div><div></div>
